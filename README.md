# WGUPS-Planning

## SCENARIO

This task is the planning phase of the WGUPS Routing Program. The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route a delivery distribution for their daily local deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.

The task to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages will be
delivered on time while meeting each package’s requirements and keeping the combined total distance
traveled under 140 miles for all trucks. The specific delivery locations and distances to each location are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.” The intent is to use the program for this specific location and also for many other cities in each state where WGUPS has a presence. The supervisor should be able to see, at assigned points, the progress of each truck and its packages by any of the variables listed in the “WGUPS Package File” including what has been delivered and at what time the delivery occurred.

## ASSUMPTIONS
- Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages, and the ID number of each package is unique.
- The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour and have an infinite amount of gas
with no need to stop.
- There are no collisions.
- Three trucks and two drivers are available for deliveries. Each driver stays with the same truck as
long as that truck is in service.
- Drivers leave the hub no earlier than 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub
for packages if needed.
- The delivery and loading times are instantaneous (i.e., no time passes while at a delivery or when
moving packages to a truck at the hub). This time is factored into the calculation of the average
speed of the trucks.
- There is up to one special note associated with a package.
- The delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, is wrong and will be corrected
at 10:20 a.m. WGUPS is aware that the address is incorrect and will be updated at 10:20 a.m.
However, WGUPS does not know the correct address (410 S. State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111)
until 10:20 a.m.
- The distances provided in the “WGUPS Distance Table” are equal regardless of the direction
traveled.
- The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.
